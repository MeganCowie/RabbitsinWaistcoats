This is me understanding how to build a website.. my first real foray into html
and css.

Each page has its own .html file:
- index.html = home page
- hodgepodgeandodgebigodge.html = hodgepodgeandodgebigodge page
- unsolicitedcommentary.html = unsolicitedcommentary hodgepodgeandodgebigodge

All of the .css formatting for each page is in the same .css file (style.css).

Finally, all images are in the images folder.

The example_index.html and example_style.css files are essentially me following
along with a YouTube tutorial by Easy Tutorials: "How to make a website using
html and css - Full responsive multi page website design step by step".

(These files will be deleted once I'm more confident in my html and css
coding abilities.)
