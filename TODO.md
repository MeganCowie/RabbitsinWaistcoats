# To Do

### Pages
hpobg intro
Semiconductors page
Home page

### Fix navlinks
I don't really like the fact that the navigation menu needs javascript. Try to re-do it using the same tricks I used for the cards. Also it's super annoying that the responsive menu is visible offscreen with a slider.

### Fix hpobg card lengths
I need to figure out some way to query the text length and adjust the card lengths accordingly.

### Footer
Footer content ideas:
- Github
- pompomswithears
- google scholar
- contact?
- side hussles


### Organization
Figure out how to get header & footer on every page without copy/pasting code.
